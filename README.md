This repository is for the submission of our assignment on "Motif Finding Problem" on 'CSE463 - Introduction to BioInformatics' course. 
The Code folder contains our implementation of 'Randomized Motif Search' and 'Gibbs Sampler' algorithm.
ALso it contains the datasets and their ground truth.
To run our code on windows machine the script is:
python main.py {filename}
filename is the name of the dataset that is being run. The dataset must be in FASTA format also its ground truth must be present is PWM format.
