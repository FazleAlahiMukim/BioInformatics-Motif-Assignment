# Motif Finding Problem Assignment

Welcome to the repository for the Motif Finding Problem assignment in the 'CSE463 - Introduction to BioInformatics' course. This repository contains implementations of the 'Randomized Motif Search' and 'Gibbs Sampler' algorithms, along with datasets and their ground truth.

## Code

The `Code` folder contains Python implementations of the 'Randomized Motif Search' and 'Gibbs Sampler' algorithms. To run the code on a Windows machine, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py {filename}
```
Replace {filename} with the name of the dataset you want to run. The dataset must be in FASTA format, and its ground truth must be present in PWM format. See the Code folder for clarity on the format of the dataset.

## Report
The Report folder contains the submitted report and its LaTeX (.tex) file. This report provides detailed documentation of the algorithms, implementation details, experimental results, and analysis.
